    <div class = "section">
    	<h2>Sunscreen / Sunblock</h2>
		<img src="images/slather-Suncreen.jfif">
		<div class="content-text">
    		
    		<p>Too much exposure from the sun is always a bad idea, so always bring a sunblock that works well with your skin. If you are trying a new product, make sure to test it on yourself before your getaway so you won’t have to deal with allergies and breakouts during your trip! Dermatologists recommend using a SPF30 – better if you can get coral reef-safe sunscreens or those that do not contain oxybenzone, octinoxate and other harmful chemicals! Its extra safer for your skin and for the marine life!</p>
    	</div>

    	<h2>Water Tumbler</h2>
		<img src="images/tumbler.jpg">
		<div class="content-text">
    		
    		<p>This is going to be your perfect companion while on the beach – whether during your activities or simply when you’re out for a stroll. It won’t only keep you hydrated, but will definitely help you save a dime! In an island destination like Boracay, always remember that water are precious commodities and are more expensive than the usual. Just ask your hotel for their service water before you head out and you’re good to go!</p>
    	</div>

    	<h2>Slippers</h2>
		<img src="images/slippers.avif">
		<div class="content-text">
    		
    		<p>The beach is the perfect place to ditch your pair of sneakers and wear your favorite pair of flip-flops. Make sure to bring your most trusted and comfortable pair as it can either make or break your getaway – one that can stand long walks on a sandy shore or a wild night-out!</p>
    	</div>

    	<h2>Sunglasses</h2>
		<img src="images/sunglasses.jpg">
		<div class="content-text">
    		
    		<p>Make sure to protect your eyes from the harmful rays of the sun with a pair of sunnies, and look stylish all the same time! While most are made of plastics and metals – there are also those that are made of bamboo which are eco-friendlier especially if you are the type who has the tendency to drop them on the water while parasailing! So choose wisely and get those biodegradable wooden shades!</p>
    	</div>

    	<h2>Swimwear</h2>
		<img src="images/swimwear.avif">
		<div class="content-text">
    		
    		<p>A trip to the beach won’t be complete without those bright and colorful swimsuits! Cover-ups will come in handy as it is still appropriate to have them on while dining on your favorite restaurant. Make sure to bring some extra clothes so you are ready in case you decide to stay a few more days (or in case of cancelled flights)!</p>
    	</div>

    	<h2>Camera/Phone</h2>
		<img src="images/camera.jpg">
		<div class="content-text">
    		
    		<p>A camera is a good way to immortalize moments! If you’re that type of person who wants to just capture some selfies, groufies, and random photos, a phone would be just fine. Just make sure to keep it out of the water since salt water can damage your gadgets.</p>
    	</div>

    	<h2>Hat/Cap</h2>
		<img src="images/hat.jpg">
		<div class="content-text">
    		
    		<p>When it’s too hot outside, a hat will keep your skin, hair, and eyes protected from the sun. It’s also a good way to hide your hair if you’re too lazy to fix it! Small or big, it’s one cool beach accessory that will definitely add flare to your OOTDs.</p>
    	</div>

    	<h2>Dry Bag</h2>
		<img src="images/bag.jpg">
		<div class="content-text">
    		
    		<p>A dry bag will come in handy when you head out to explore the island. It will keep all of your beach essentials in place, safe and dry! They come in different sizes, but a small one would be enough to carry around the beach.</p>
    	</div>

    	<h2>Power Bank</h2>
		<img src="images/powerbank.jpg">
		<div class="content-text">
    		
    		<p>A must bring essential is also the power bank. Invest in a lightweight power bank that you can slip in your pocket or in your purse. It will make sure that your phone won’t die on you while you’re posting some stories or capturing that glorious sunset!</p>
    	</div>

    	<h2>Pack a Med-kit</h2>
		<img src="images/medkit.jpg">
		<div class="content-text">
    		
    		<p>Sometimes, too much sun or too much activities can cause you feeling under the weather. It’s hard to walk down to a pharmacy when you’re not feeling well or worst if it’s raining. Always have medicines and an emergency med-kit in your bag, just in case you get down with fever, upset stomach or headache! With all of these essentials, surely you’re all set for the perfect Boracay getaway.</p>
