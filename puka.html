    		<p>Puka Beach is a serene destination in Boracay that boasts a white-sand shore that contains bits of coral. Going on for 800 meters, it is also one of the longest beaches on the island. <br><br>While the bits of coral make its sand slightly more coarse than those of the White Beach, this spot makes up for it with its almost unspoiled natural beauty. Puka Beach is lined with tall coconut trees as well, and has a lush tropical forest just past its stunning shore.<br><br>It is also home to Boracay's flying foxes, which are a species of fruit bats. From the shore, you can spot these animals flying around at night when they are most active.</p>
