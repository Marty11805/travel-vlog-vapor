    		<h2>Tip #1 Check for ATMs on the islands in the Philippines</h2>
    		<p>As you fix up your travel plans around the islands of the Philippines, don’t assume there’ll be an ATM where you’re staying.<br><br>Either research ahead of time or ask your hostel/hotel.<br><br> On the same note, not all ATMs in the Philippines take international cards so always think ahead about your money needs. You may need to stock up on Philippine Pesos a little way ahead.</p>

    	<div class="content-text">
    		<h2>Tip #2 Pack Plenty Of Grub</h2>
    		<p>Although it feels like fun, swimming and running around on the sand is actually really good exercise, which means you and your kiddos or grandkiddos will be burning extra calories. Pack a cooler or hot/cold bag with lots of healthy food for the whole family and refuel often. If you want to be extra prepped, freeze your drinks the night before for cool beverages all day long.</p>

    	</div>
    	<div class="content-text">
    		<h2>Tip #3 Head Out Early</h2>
    		<p>Prime locations near the water can fill up fast, so you'll want to arrive at the beach early to stake your claim with a beach blanket, towel, umbrella, etc. Then your spot becomes just that — your spot for as long as you stay. Latecomers may find the most desirable areas are already full, so be the early bird and get that worm.</p>

    	</div>
    	<div class="content-text">
    		<h2>Tip #4 Bring Extra bags</h2>
    		<p>It's no fun going back to your resort dripping wet. Extra bags can come in handy for transporting wet clothing and towels, as well as for packing up your trash. Leaving trash on the beach is extremely harmful for wildlife, not to mention it's actually illegal in many places (and just not cool). Bag it up and pack it out!</p>

    	</div>
    	<div class="content-text">
    		<h2>Tip #5 Protect Your Phone</h2>
    		<p>Wet phone = beach day bummer (total understatement). Put that expensive mobile device in a re-sealable plastic bag to keep out water and sand. A sandwich baggie will do, or many retailers sell sturdier re-sealable bags designed for beach protection. Might be a good investment for you regular beach bums.</p>

    	<div class="content-text">
    		<h2>Tip #6 Leave Designer Shades At Home</h2>
    		<p>The number one item that ends up broken, stolen, or forgotten on beach trips is sunglasses. Your Ray Bans look awesome, no doubt, but you'll be heartbroken if they get lost or damaged. Bring that bargain pair you bought at the gas station instead.</p>

    	<div class="content-text">
    		<h2>Tip #7 Safely Stash Your Valuables</h2>
    		<p>Leaving your keys, wallet, and phone laying out unprotected on your beach towel is like a beacon to thieves while you're splashing in the waves. Get creative about storing them out of sight. An empty sunscreen bottle, a Pringles jar, a non-transparent water bottle, or even inside a folded-up diaper could be just the place to keep those valuables safely out of sight.</p>

    	<div class="content-text">
    		<h2>Tip #8 Bring Extra Clothes & Towels</h2>
    		<p>It might sound like a no-brainer, but many beach-goers have forgotten this once or twice. Since the beach is a place where things sometimes get wet, you all know what happens when someone's clothes, shoes, or towel accidentally gets soaked (cue the whining, moaning, and complaining). Be prepared with extras, just in case.</p>

    		<h2>Tip #9 Leave plenty of time for travelling between islands in the Philippines</h2>
    		<p>This is really important advice for travelling around the Philippines.<br><br>In the planning stages, it can be wise to dedicate an entire day to travelling between islands in the Philippines. All the segments can add up, or sometimes the only option is to fly back to Manila to catch another fight to the next island.<br><br>Generally, you should leave as much time as possible whilst moving around on travelling days. Weather, cancellations, traffic – all these things can have a big impact on travel in the Philippines.</p>

    		<h2>Tip #10 Last But Not Least, Unwind</h2>
    		<p>It's hard to make memories with your family if you're glued to your phone or tablet. It's easy to get caught up in what's going on at work or on social media, but you might miss out on the simple pleasures that are right in front of you. Don't let that special moment pass you by. Snap a photo or two, and then stash it away. You'll be glad you did.</p>
